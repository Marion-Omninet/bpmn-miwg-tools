ARIS Express does not have BPMN import or export capabilities.

This set of BPMN samples was created by manually drawing reference models directly in ARIS Express.
  1. Files *.adf are original ARIS Express models in their native format.
  2. Files *.png are exported from ARIS Express as follows:
        > File > Export > As graphic.. > Output file > Portable Network Graphics (*.png)
  3. Files *.pdf are exported from ARIS Express as follows:
        > File > Export > Graphic as PDF..
