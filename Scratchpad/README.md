This folder shows how to access a Google Docs spreadsheet and how to convert this spreadsheet into Javascript data structures.

The HTML file needs to be loaded from a web server (e.g., like the one provided by XAMPP).
Otherwise, the Browsers will prohibit access to the Google Docs spreadsheet.

All processing is done in the browser. There is no server-side logic.

Tested with Chrome and Firefox.
